>Rule 1: Do not design your own crypto
>Rule 2: Do not implement your own crypto

**jhcrypto** is my personal implementation of a few encryption schemes as well as a collection of breaks following `cryptopals.com`. Roadmap/completion:

* AES (*in progress*)
    * ECB
    * CBC
* Diffie-Hellman
* ECC
